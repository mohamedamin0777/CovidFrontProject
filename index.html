                                        new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing
                                        coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that

                                        a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how
                                        COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and
                                        gossip that spreads rumors and myths.Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear

                                        in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect
                                        animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect
                                        people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the
                                        virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
                                        Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that

                                        China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus
                                        is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that
                                        person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly
                                        contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.The virus that causes
                                        COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community
                                        (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community spread means
                                        people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not
                                        sure how or where they became infected.Learn what is known about the spread of

                                        person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the
                                        illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated
                                        either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they
                                        are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.How long someone is
                                        actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation
                                        is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection
                                        prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves
                                        considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness
                                        signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.Current
                                        CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a
                                        case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:The
                                        patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.The
                                        patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.The patient has tested
                                        negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24
                                        hours apart.Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to
                                        pose a risk of infection to others.</p>

                                        person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to
                                        support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or
                                        eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20
                                        seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                                        blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.It may be
                                        possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has
                                        the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
                                        but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.In general, because
                                        of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very
                                        low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a
                                        period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.Learn

                                        your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world
                                        have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in
                                        China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their
                                        outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the
                                        latest news. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19
                                        by taking some simple precautions: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands
                                        with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing
                                        your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses
                                        that may be on your hands. Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between
                                        yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or
                                        sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may
                                        contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including
                                        the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. Avoid touching eyes,
                                        nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once
                                        contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From
                                        there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. Make sure you, and
                                        the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your
                                        mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then
                                        dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following
                                        good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as
                                        cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough
                                        and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the
                                        directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities
                                        will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling
                                        in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the
                                        right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of
                                        viruses and other infections. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots
                                        (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid
                                        traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes,
                                        heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one
                                        of these areas.</p>

                                        provider’s instructions for medication(s) and care. You should help the patient
                                        with basic needs in the home and provide support for getting groceries,
                                        prescriptions, and other personal needs. Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the
                                        patient is getting sicker, call his or her healthcare provider and tell them
                                        that the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the
                                        healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people in the office or
                                        waiting room from getting infected. Ask the healthcare provider to call the
                                        local or state health department for additional guidance. If the patient has a
                                        medical emergency and you need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that
                                        the patient has, or is being evaluated for COVID-19. Household members should
                                        stay in another room or be separated from the patient as much as possible.
                                        Household members should use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available.
                                        Prohibit visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home. Household
                                        members should care for any pets in the home. Do not handle pets or other
                                        animals while sick. For more information, see COVID-19 and Animals. Make sure
                                        that shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as by an air conditioner
                                        or an opened window, weather permitting. Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash
                                        your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an
                                        alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all
                                        surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and
                                        water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty. Avoid touching
                                        your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. The patient should wear a
                                        facemask when you are around other people. If the patient is not able to wear a
                                        facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), you, as the
                                        caregiver, should wear a mask when you are in the same room as the patient. Wear
                                        a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the
                                        patient’s blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus,
                                        vomit, urine. Throw out disposable facemasks and gloves after using them. Do not
                                        reuse. When removing personal protective equipment, first remove and dispose of
                                        gloves. Then, immediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based
                                        hand sanitizer. Next, remove and dispose of facemask, and immediately clean your
                                        hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid sharing
                                        household items with the patient. You should not share dishes, drinking glasses,
                                        cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items. After the patient uses
                                        these items, you should wash them thoroughly (see below “Wash laundry
                                        thoroughly”). Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops,
                                        doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside
                                        tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body
                                        fluids on them. Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label
                                        instructions. Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the
                                        cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying the
                                        product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during
                                        use of the product. Wash laundry thoroughly. Immediately remove and wash clothes
                                        or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. Wear disposable
                                        gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body.
                                        Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer)
                                        immediately after removing your gloves. Read and follow directions on labels of
                                        laundry or clothing items and detergent. In general, using a normal laundry
                                        detergent according to washing machine instructions and dry thoroughly using the
                                        warmest temperatures recommended on the clothing label. Place all used
                                        disposable gloves, facemasks, and other contaminated items in a lined container
                                        before disposing of them with other household waste. Clean your hands (with soap
                                        and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after handling these
                                        items. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.
                                        Discuss any additional questions with your state or local health department or

                                        dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose,
                                        sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
                                        Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel
                                        unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
                                        treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously
                                        ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying

                                        likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty

                                        increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.</p>

                                        work. Follow the steps below: Protect yourself and others. Stay home if you are
                                        sick. Keep away from people who are sick. Limit close contact with others as
                                        much as possible (about 6 feet). Put your household plan into action. Stay
                                        informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Be aware of temporary school
                                        dismissals in your area, as this may affect your household’s daily routine.
                                        Continue practicing everyday preventive actions. Cover coughs and sneezes with a
                                        tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If
                                        soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60%
                                        alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular
                                        household detergent and water. Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your
                                        regular work schedule changes. Ask to work from home or take leave if you or
                                        someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s
                                        school is dismissed temporarily. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for
                                        and respond to COVID-19. Stay in touch with others by phone or email. If you
                                        have a chronic medical condition and live alone, ask family, friends, and health
                                        care providers to check on you during an outbreak. Stay in touch with family and
                                        friends, especially those at increased risk of developing severe illness, such
                                        as older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions.</p>

                                        far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness,
                                        including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older
                                        adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the school
                                        may dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or
                                        watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are
                                        dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed. If
                                        your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility
                                        or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they
                                        can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork. Discourage children and teens
                                        from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the

                                        support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or
                                        eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20
                                        seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                                        blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom. It may be
                                        possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has
                                        the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
                                        but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. In general,
                                        because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is
                                        likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped
                                        over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.
